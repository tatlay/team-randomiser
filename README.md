# team-randomiser

The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names (10 players = 2 teams of 5).

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams
support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly
